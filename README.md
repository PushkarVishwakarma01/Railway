# 🚆 RailSense: AI-Powered Train Traffic Control System  

### 📌 Problem Statement  
Indian Railways faces challenges in **train traffic management**, especially in avoiding collisions, handling delays, and optimizing signal control. Current systems are either manual or semi-automated, which leads to inefficiencies.  

This project, developed for **Smart India Hackathon (SIH 2025)**, aims to build an **AI-powered precise train traffic control system** that can **simulate, monitor, and optimize** railway traffic using **real-time data, predictive AI models, and automated signal management.**

## ✨ Features  
- 🔄 **Railway Traffic Simulator** – Models train movement between blocks, signals, and stations.  
- 🚦 **Smart Signal Control** – Automatically updates signal states based on train occupancy.  
- 🤖 **AI/ML Integration(Upcoming)** – Predicts delays, congestion, and optimal routing.  
- 📊 **Dashboard (Future Scope)** – Real-time monitoring of trains, signals, and block usage.  
- 🗄 **Database Integration** – Stores train, block, and signal data for analysis.  
- ⚡ **Scalable Microservice Design(Building)** – Ready for expansion into real-world railway systems.
